BootCamp Module 2 Challenge
This is my repository for my Module 2 Challenge for BootCamp.
Included are 3 files, with the screenshots of my results pulled from the excel resource "Multi Year Data". Each image is a screenshot of the original data on the left, 
and the right columns have the  summary table of each ticker. These are labeled with the corrsponding year that data is pulled from

Next, I have my actual code that I used in VBA to make the tables to summarize the data
